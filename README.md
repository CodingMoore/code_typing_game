# **code_typing_game**
Initial Start Date: 2020-11-30

## **Project Description**
This project pits the user against a timer and her keyboard. Want to type all those weird [maybe we should just bring in the description already written on the Team Week 1 sign up Google Sheet?...]

The screen will tell you your percentage of keystrokes correct. If you meet your set goals for speed and accuracy, a GOLD STAR will pop up, too!
## **Required for Use**
A browser that can run HTML5 is required.
